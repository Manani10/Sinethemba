          <p> 
            I'm a young humble lady from Pietermaritzburg KwaZulu Natal. 
            I studied a Bsc Mathematical Science degree majoring in computer science and applied mathematics at Sefako Makgatho Health Science University.
            I'm currently enrolled at Sefako Makgatho Health Science University for my Honours Degree in Computer and Information Technology.
            I enjoy coding languages such as java and PHP.But have hopes to extending my knowledge to code in Python.
            I enjoy learning new things being challenged to become a better version of personal and professional self. I believe my strong traits are never giving up
            and looking at the bright side of everything I do.
